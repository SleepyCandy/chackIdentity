Read me first!

Thanks for using EasyWSDL generator. You have generated classes using Free account which has two main limitations, which are:
1. Classes generated by Free account cannot be used in commercial projects
2. We have generated a half of your methods only (in this case your webservice contains 2 operations, and we have generated 1 only. The other methods throw UnsupportedOperationException)

Basically you should use these classes for testing purposes. You can check if our generator works with your web service, without spending any money. Then if you are satisfied with the results, you can buy a Premium account and generated your classes again.


How to use generated classes:

1. In your android/java project create a new package folder (name of this folder should match the Package name of generated classes)
2. Go to src subfolder of generated package and copy all files to your project (to newly created folder).
3. In libs subfolder you will find all jars needed for generated classes. Copy all jars to your project and add references to them (every IDE has different way of adding refenreces to external jars)
4. Add INTERNET permission to your AndroidManifest.xml file:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
5. Use the following code to connect to your webservice:

NJSchecktinpinserviceSoap service = new NJSchecktinpinserviceSoap();
service.MethodToInvoke(...);

More documentation and examples you will find in doc folder in the generated zip file.

Used libraries:

- ExKsoap2 v1.0.2.0 (http://easywsdl.com/) - extended version of ksoap2 library with MTOM transfer support and WS-* standards implementation.
